This library allows you to split up large binary messages into multiple
chunks of a certain size.

When converting data to chunks, a 9 byte header is prepended to each
chunk. This allows you to send the chunks to the receiver in any order.

While the library was originally written for use with WebRTC
DataChannels, it can also be used outside of that scope.

The full specification for the chunking format can be found
[here](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta/blob/master/Chunking.md).


## Installing

If you're writing a browser application, simply use the normal or
minified ES5 distribution from the `dist` directory.

    <script src="chunked-dc.es5.min.polyfill.js"></script>

If you have a build pipeline yourself, you may also want to use the ES2015
version instead. The ES5 polyfill version is considerably larger because it
also contains ES5 polyfills.

Alternatively, simply install the library via `npm`:

    npm install --save @saltyrtc/chunked-dc

All classes in the ES5 version are namespaced under `chunkedDc`:

- `chunkedDc.Chunker`
- `chunkedDc.Unchunker`

To build the distributions yourself, simply run `npm install && npm run dist`
in the main directory.


## Usage

### Chunking

For each message that you want to split into chunks, pass it to a `Chunker`.

```javascript
let messageId = 1337;
let message = Uint8Array.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
let chunkSize = 12; // Chunk size *including* 9 byte header
let chunker = new Chunker(messageId, message, chunkSize);
```

You can then process all chunks using the iterator/iterable protocol:

```javascript
for (let chunk of chunker) {
    // Send chunk to peer
}
```

Alternatively you can also use the `next()` method directly:

```javascript
while (chunker.hasNext) {
    let chunk = chunker.next().value;
    // Send chunk to peer
}
```

The example above will return 3 chunks (header prefix not shown):
`[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]`.

### Unchunking

This library works both if chunks are sent in ordered or unordered
manner. Because ordering is not guaranteed, the Unchunker instance
accepts chunks and stores them in an internal data structure. As soon as
all chunks of a message have arrived, a listener will be notified.
Repeated chunks with the same serial will be ignored.

Create the Unchunker instance:

```javascript
let unchunker = new Unchunker();
```

Register a message listener:

```javascript
unchunker.onMessage = (message: Uint8Array, context: any[]) => {
    // Do something with the received message
};
```

Finally, when new chunks arrive, simply add them to the `Unchunker` instance:

```
let chunk = ...; // ArrayBuffer
unchunker.add(chunk);
```

You may also pass some context object to the unchunker which will be
stored together with the chunk. When the `onMessage` handler is
notified, these context objects will be passed in as a list ordered by
chunk serial.

### Cleanup

Because the `Unchunker` instance needs to keep track of arrived chunks,
it's possible that incomplete messages add up and use a lot of memory
without ever being freed.

To avoid this, simply call the `Unchunker.gc(maxAge: number)` method
regularly. It will remove all incomplete messages that haven't been
updated for more than `maxAge` milliseconds.

### Constants

This library exposes the following constants:

- `HEADER_LENGTH`: The number of bytes in the chunk header


## Format

The chunking format is described
[in the specification](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta/blob/master/Chunking.md).


## Type Declarations

If you use TypeScript, simply reference the `chunked-dc.d.ts` type
declaration file to get type checking and autocompletion.


## Testing

This library has an extensive test suite. To run it:

    npm install
    npm run rollup_tests

Then open `tests.html` in your browser to run the test suite.
